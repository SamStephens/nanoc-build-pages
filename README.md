# Nanoc-Build-Pages

A simple GitHub Action for producing Nanoc build artifacts compatible with GitHub Pages. Derived from [jekyll-build-pages](https://github.com/actions/jekyll-build-pages).

# Scope

This is used along with [`actions/deploy-pages`](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages) to use Github's support for building Pages with Actions.

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml).

As far as the actual workflow you will need, [here's an example from my own website using this action](https://github.com/SamStephens/antipatterns.postmoderncore.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-deploy-page.yml).
